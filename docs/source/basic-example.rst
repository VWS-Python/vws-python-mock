Using the mock redirects requests to Vuforia made with `requests`_ to an in-memory implementation.

.. code-block:: python

    """Make a request to the Vuforia Web Services API mock."""

    import requests

    from mock_vws import MockVWS
    from mock_vws.database import VuforiaDatabase

    with MockVWS() as mock:
        database = VuforiaDatabase()
        mock.add_database(database=database)
        # This will use the Vuforia mock.
        requests.get(url="https://vws.vuforia.com/summary", timeout=30)

By default, an exception will be raised if any requests to unmocked addresses are made.

See :ref:`mock-api-reference` for details of what can be changed and how.
